I wanted an easy-to-reason-about example of supporting two-factor auth with [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en), so I made it!

Since Google Authenticator is just an implementation of [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm), what I made is really how to use TOTP in an ASP.NET MVC page.  It uses basic, easy-to-reason-about session and user repositories to support the core of the demo.  It uses [OTP Sharp](https://bitbucket.org/devinmartin/otp-sharp) for the actual TOTP algorythm implementation.  It also uses [QRCode.js](https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs) to display the secret to the user for ease of configuration of a mobile app like Google Authenticator.  Other than MVC, it doesn't use any frameworks, which makes it easy to see exactly what is happening with the two-factor authentication aspect of the code.

I relied on [Jerrie Pelser's blog post](http://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-google-authenticator-asp-net-identity) to create this demo, and also incorporated [cheuer](https://github.com/jerriep/ASPNETIdentity_GoogleAuthenticator/pull/1)'s method of rendering the QR code.
